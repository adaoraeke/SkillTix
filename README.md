# SkillTix — Skill Trade & Barter Platform

A decentralized marketplace built on the Stacks blockchain that enables peer-to-peer skill trading and bartering through smart contract automation, reputation-based NFTs, and community-driven dispute resolution.

## Overview

SkillTix revolutionizes the gig economy by creating a trustless environment where individuals can trade their skills directly without traditional payment intermediaries. Whether you're a plumber looking for web design services or a chef wanting to learn guitar, SkillTix connects skill providers through intelligent matching algorithms and secures transactions through blockchain technology.

## Vision

## Smart Contract Architecture

### SkillMatchingEngine Contract
```clarity
;; Core matching logic with compatibility scoring
(define-public (create-skill-offer (skill-category uint) (description (string-ascii 256))))
(define-public (create-skill-request (skill-category uint) (description (string-ascii 256))))
(define-read-only (find-matches (user principal)))
(define-read-only (calculate-compatibility-score (offer-id uint) (request-id uint)))
```

### StakingEscrow Contract  
```clarity
;; Collateral management with automated release
(define-public (create-escrow (counterparty principal) (amount uint)))
(define-public (fund-escrow (escrow-id uint)))
(define-public (confirm-completion (escrow-id uint)))
(define-public (release-funds (escrow-id uint)))
```

### ReputationNFT Contract
```clarity
;; Skill-based achievement tokens
(define-public (mint-skill-badge (recipient principal) (skill-category uint)))
(define-read-only (get-user-badges (user principal)))
(define-read-only (calculate-reputation-score (user principal)))
